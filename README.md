# files-rs: Personal file storage API

`files-rs` is a simple file storage service, written in Rust btw.

## Project archived, see memo-rs project instead

https://github.com/lysender/memo-rs

It is designed for personal use and not indended for large number of concurrent users.
The goal of the service is to provide an economical way to store and retrieve
files in the cloud.

See [memo-rs](https://github.com/lysender/memo-rs) to deploy a frontend for this service.

Uses cases:
- Store personal files and documents
- Online photo album

## Features 

- [x] JSON API endpoints to manage files
- [x] Multi-tenant
- [x] Multi-bucket
- [x] Google Cloud Storage
- [x] SQLite database
- [x] JWT authentication
- [x] Role based authorization
- [x] Tenants/clients management via CLI
- [x] Users management via CLI
- [x] Buckets management via CLI

## Workflow

- Tenants/clients are like organizations
- Each client have users and cloud storage buckets
- Files are organized in directories under a bucket
- Each directory have the following sub-directories:
  - orig - original file
  - preview - web optimized image preview
  - thumb - web optimized image thumbnail
- File metadata is collected
  - Content type
  - Size
  - Image dimension for each version

## Google Cloud Service Account

Create a Google Cloud Service Account with the following roles:
- Storage Folder Admin
- Storage HMAC Key Admin
- Storage Insights Collector Service
- Storage Object Admin

## Clients

Clients are the tenants or customers of the service.

Each client has access to the following resources:
- teams
- users
- buckets
- directories
- files

All clients are managed via the CLI only.

```bash
./files-rs clients list
./files-rs clients create name
./files-rs clients disable client_id
./files-rs clients enable client_id
./files-rs clients delete client_id
```

Client:
- id
- name
- status: active, inactive
- created_at

## Users

Each clients can have users with roles the define the permissions to access client resources.
Users are managed via CLI only as well.

```bash
./files-rs users list client_id
./files-rs users create client_id username
./files-rs users enable id 
./files-rs users disable id 
./files-rs users delete id 
```

User:
- id
- client_id
- username
- password
- status: active, inactive
- roles: csv of roles
- created_at
- updated_at

Usename is unique globally although it is namespaced by client_id.

### Roles

- FilesAdmin
- FilesEditor
- FilesViewer

### Permissions

- dirs.create
- dirs.edit
- dirs.delete
- dirs.list
- dirs.view
- dirs.manage
- files.create
- files.edit
- files.delete
- files.list
- files.view
- files.manage

### Roles to Permissions Mapping

FilesAdmin:
- dirs.create
- dirs.edit
- dirs.delete
- dirs.list
- dirs.view
- dirs.manage
- files.create
- files.edit
- files.delete
- files.list
- files.view
- files.manage

Summary: Admins have full access to directories and files

FilesEditor:
- dirs.list
- dirs.view
- files.create
- files.list
- files.view

Summary: Editors can view and upload new files

FilesViewer:
- dirs.list
- dirs.view
- files.list
- files.view

Summary: Viewers can only view directories and files

## Buckets

Buckets are created outside of the application, like in Google Console or using gsutil.
They are added into the client resources via the CLI.

When adding a bucket, make sure it already exists in the cloud storage.

```bash
./files-rs buckets list client_id
./files-rs buckets create client_id bucket_name
./files-rs buckets delete bucket_id
```

## Models

Bucket:
- id
- client_id
- name
- images_only
- created_at

Dir:
- id
- bucket_id
- name
- label
- file_count
- created_at
- updated_at

File:
- id
- dir_id 
- name
- filename
- content_type
- size
- is_image
- img_dimention 
- img_versions
- created_at
- updated_at

## API Endpoints

```
GET /v1/auth/token
GET /v1/buckets
POST /v1/buckets
GET /v1/buckets/:bucket_id
PATCH /v1/buckets/:bucket_id
DELETE /v1/buckets/:bucket_id
GET /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs?page=1&per_page=10&keyword=
POST /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs
GET /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs/:dir_id
PATCH /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs/:dir_id
DELETE /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs/:dir_id
GET /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs/:dir_id/files?page=1&per_page=10&keyword=
POST /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs/:dir_id/files
GET /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs/:dir_id/files/:file_id
DELETE /v1/buckets/:bucket_id/dirs/:dir_id/files/:file_id
```

## Database client setup

```
# Only when not yet installed 
sudo apt-get -y install libsqlite3-dev

# Required by our ORM and migration tool
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```

## Configuration by ENV variables

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://db/db.sqlite3
JWT_SECRET=value
UPLOAD_DIR=/path/to/upload_dir
PORT=11001

GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=value
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
```

## Build binary

```
cargo build --release
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the application in many ways. In this example, we deploy
it as a simple systemd service.

### Setup systemd

Edit systemd service file:

```
sudo systemctl edit --force --full files-rs.service
```

File: `/etc/systemd/system/files-rs.service`

```
